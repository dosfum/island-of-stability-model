# Superheavy Element Decay Modeling: Island of Stability Analysis

This project presents a predictive decay analysis across superheavy isotopes (Z = 114‚Äì121, A = 385‚Äì400) to identify candidates with potential alpha-stable behavior near the hypothesized island of stability.

## üî¨ Methodology

- **Q‚Çê Energetics** estimated using a semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF)
- **Alpha Decay Half-Lives** from the Geiger‚ÄìNuttall law
- **Spontaneous Fission (SF)** modeled via Z¬≤/A instability heuristic
- **Shell Correction** applied for Z = 114, N = 184‚Äì196 using a √ó10¬π‚Å∞ SF half-life boost
- **Stability Score**:  
  \[
  \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{SF Half-Life}}{\text{Alpha Half-Life}}\right)
  \]

## üìà Key Results

- Q‚Çê becomes energetically favorable above A ‚âà 392
- Without shell suppression, SF dominates all isotopes
- With suppression modeled, **Flerovium-396 to 400 (Z = 114)** show positive stability scores
- These isotopes are proposed as synthesis candidates for observing measurable alpha decay chains
