# Superheavy Element Decay Modeling: Island of Stability Analysis

This project models alpha decay and spontaneous fission lifetimes for superheavy isotopes (Z = 114–121, A = 385–400), identifying viable synthesis targets within the predicted "island of stability."

### 🔬 Methodology
- Qₐ computed using semi-empirical mass formula
- Alpha half-lives via Geiger–Nuttall law
- SF modeled via Z²/A instability and shell suppression
- Stability Score = log₁₀(SF HL / Alpha HL)

### 📈 Results
- Qₐ becomes favorable (Qₐ > 0) near A = 392–400
- Without shell effects, SF dominates all isotopes
- With shell suppression at Z = 114, N = 184–196:
  - **Flerovium-396 to Flerovium-400** emerge as prime alpha-stable candidates

### 📊 Visuals
- Qₐ heatmap
- Decay mode dominance
- Adjusted stability scores
- Relative gain for Z = 114
